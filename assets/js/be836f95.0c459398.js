This is our final episode, and we're going big - humanoid robots. These are the machines that capture our imagination: walking, talking, working alongside humans.\n\nWhy build robots that look like humans? Our world is designed for human bodies. Stairs are sized for human legs. Doorknobs are positioned for human hands. Chairs, desks, vehicles, tools - everything assumes a human operator. A humanoid robot can navigate this world without modification.\n\nHere's a humbling fact: walking is hard. Toddlers spend months mastering it. Walking is dynamically unstable - you're essentially falling forward and catching yourself with each step.\n\nThe key concept is the Zero Moment Point, or ZMP. For stable walking, the ZMP must stay within the support polygon - the area enclosed by the feet touching the ground. When you stand on both feet, this area is large. When you step, one foot lifts, and the polygon shrinks.\n\nThe Linear Inverted Pendulum Model simplifies walking dynamics. Using this model, you can compute center of mass trajectories that keep the ZMP stable. Whole-body control takes these high-level goals and computes joint torques to achieve them.\n\nReinforcement learning has transformed locomotion. Using physics simulation, robots learn from millions of trial-and-error episodes. The results are remarkable - RL-trained robots navigate rough terrain with agility that traditional methods can't match.\n\nWalking is hard, but manipulation might be harder. Human hands have over 20 degrees of freedom with exquisite force sensing. We can thread needles and lift heavy boxes. Most robot hands simplify this, using fewer fingers with limited dexterity.\n\nWe're at an inflection point for humanoids. Boston Dynamics' Atlas does parkour. Agility's Digit is deployed in warehouses. Tesla's Optimus is rapidly iterating. I believe we'll see commercially viable humanoids in the next decade.\n\nThis brings us to the end of our journey through Physical AI. We've covered ROS2, simulation, Isaac Sim, VLA models, and humanoid robotics. Thank you for listening.
