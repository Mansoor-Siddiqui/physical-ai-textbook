# Episode 3: Robot Simulation

**[INTRO MUSIC]**

Welcome to the Physical AI Podcast! I'm your host, and today we're diving into robot simulation.

**[OUTRO]**

That's all for today's episode on robot simulation. If you enjoyed this, check out the corresponding chapter in the textbook for code examples and deeper technical details.

Next time, we'll explore even more exciting topics in Physical AI.

Until then, keep building, keep learning, and remember - the future of AI isn't just in the cloud, it's all around us.
